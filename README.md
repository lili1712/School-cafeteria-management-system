# School-cafeteria-meal-reservation-Java-App
This a class group project where we built a java app that simulates meal reservation for students in the school cafeteria. The idea behind the project was to replace having to queue every time to buy tickets for every meal with simply doing it over the phone anywhere anytime. There is also a version built with C.

The student has to login into his account so he can access his profile that contains all his meal reservations as well as how much money he has left to buy tickets, he can also access the week's menu and different meals to choose from. There is also an admin account for the administration so they can modify anything that needs to in the application.
